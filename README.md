## Notes

This config extends **[standard][] v9 javascript style** and just add few more rules to it,
which leads to more readable code. Most of the rules here, are already suggested in the
Standard repo, but they are just proposals, so they may or may not be included in the v9 or v10 version
of the Standard. I just want one very stable place with all needed things included. Don't want 
separate CLI too, since we have ESLint CLI which works great.

**Status: Locked**
- Does not accepts changes - everyone can sit on top of it, like this sits on top of Standard
- Meant to be used as _config_, won't include CLI - probably, not make much sense
- This isn't a CLI tool - we have ESLint CLI already

### Changes
Most noticeable change is that we

- Disallow computed property spacing, this `foo[ 'bar' ]` is just too ugly - [computed-property-spacing](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/computed-property-spacing)
  * Standard allows both styles, through the `eslint-plugin-standard` option called `either`

### Adds

In addition we have few more rules

- Maximum line length should always be strictly 80, we ignore comments - [max-len](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-len)
- Maximum params to be 3, hence more leads to very big and complex code/functions - [max-params](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-params)
  * If that's your case, you are encouraged to split your code more
- Always use parens with arrow functions - [arrow-parens](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/arrow-parens)
- Maximum one statement per line, please - [max-statements-per-line](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-statements-per-line) 
- Maximum 10 statements per scope - [max-statements](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-statements)
- No nested hell - maximum 5 nested callbacks ([max-nested-callbacks](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-nested-callbacks)) and depth ([max-depth](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-depth))
  * If that's your case, reogranize code, increase or disable with eslint style comments
- No extra semi - hence, we use style without **any** semicolons - [no-extra-semi](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-extra-semi)
- No empty blocks and statements - [no-empty](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-empty). But allowing empty `catch (er) {}`s
- Prefer destructing of arrays and objects when possible, because we're in 2017 - [prefer-destructuring](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-destructuring)
- Prefer arrow block body only if needed - [arrow-body-style](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/arrow-body-style), so
  * No `() => { return { a: 1 } }`, when you can just `() => ({ a: 1 })`
  * No `() => { return 1 }`, when `() => 1` is enough

### Badge

Since this is just _thin_ layer on top of **the Standard**, I don't think we should release our own badge. But in 
another hand - we are a bit different, so preferebly just call it `code style charlike`.

So in case you use the charlike style in your projects or just want to support and promote it, then 
include this badge in your README file.

```

## Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```
$ npm install eslint-config-charlike --save
```

or install using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```
$ yarn add eslint-config-charlike
```

## Usage

This config is designed to work with the `extends` feature of [eslint][] inside
the `.eslintrc` files. You can learn more about [Shareable Configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) on the
official ESLint website.

Install it then add this to your `.eslintrc` file:

```json
{
  "extends": "charlike"
}
```

**Note**: We omitted the `eslint-config-` prefix since it is automatically assumed by ESLint.
You can override settings from the shareable config by adding them directly into your `.eslintrc` file.

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/eslint-config-charlike/issues/new).  
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
